These are the Vim commands applied to the [flattened_dark](https://github.com/romainl/flattened/blob/master/colors/flattened_dark.vim) colour scheme (commit 86656af) in order to transmogrify it into vim-crunchbang.

## notes

Each block of above code alters the original colour scheme in the following ways:

- comments are removed
- theme name is changed
- colours are switched
- colours assigned to certain elements are changed
  - cursor background
  - current line number text
  - status line text and background
- a credit comment block is appended

## rgb replacement

These commands are used to transmogrify [Solarized Konsole](https://github.com/phiggins/konsole-colors-solarized) into the crunchbang Konsole/QTerminal theme.
